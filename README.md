This is a replica of the Atari Game Breakout.  

Press A to move the paddle left and D to move the paddle right. Press R to go back to the main menu  
  
Start the game by using the 'Play' option in Unreal Engine 4 not the 'Launch' option.  
  
**Game Description:**   
  
  
What is the main action of the game?  
The main action of the game is moving/positioning the paddle so that it can hit the moving ball. The moving ball destroys blocks it hits and if all blocks in the level are destroyed then the player has won. If the paddle misses the ball and the ball touches the bottom wall then the player loses.  
  
What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?  
Getting the physics to work was definitely the hardest part/most time consuming part of making the game. Though Unreal Engine has a built in physics engine I still encountered issues initially like the ball sticking to objects instead of bouncing off them. Making the main menu also took a fair amount of time but I did not have as many issues/bugs as I did when working on the physics.  
  
What is the most interesting part about the game?  
The actual gameplay itself. The main menu is quite simple so most of the depth of the game is within the gameplay. Specifically an interesting point about the gameplay is it is quite hard to win. I had quite a few attempts recording the video and had to scrap a lot of them because I kept losing.
